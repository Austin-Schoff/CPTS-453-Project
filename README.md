# CPTS 453 – TSP Algorithms Project

This project implements and compares three algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) on a weighted complete graph:

- **Nearest Neighbor (NN) + 2-opt**
- **Christofides Algorithm**
- **Held–Karp Dynamic Programming (Exact)**

The program generates a graph, runs each algorithm, and reports the resulting tour, cost, and runtime, followed by a summary comparison table.
